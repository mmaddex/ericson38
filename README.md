# Ericson 38
This is the boat model of s/v Paramita, my 1984 Ericson 38. It currently includes:
* .skp (SketchUp) files for physical models.
* .sch (gSchem) files for electrical schematics 
* .ods (open spreadsheet) files for electrical wiring point to point tables

I don't intend to ever make it too polished, I mainly created it to help me redesign some deck chain plates (included in the components directory) - which was a smashing success! I drew up designs for all the deck chainplates. I made the angle of the forward and aft lowers to point at the mast based solely on the original drawings since I wasn't on my boat to make measurements. I had them fabricated, both the forward and aft lowers were within 1Â° of my actual measurements. Its also quite nice for mapping out physically where wires/plumbing run. I add these systems as I happen to work on them.
